Problem 1: Design a program that prompts the user once for a list of floating point values and at the end provides the user with teh average, the smallest, the largest and the range

Start Problem 1
	declare variables for new input, total, smallest, largest, average, range, number of inputs
	declare a boolean for skipping math if needed
	Prompt User to enter a list of floating point numbers and type done to end list
	do {
		take the next line of text
		parse the int (catch exception with a flag to skip math this time)
		if not skipping math this time
			total += new input
			if smallest > new input
				smallest = new input
			if largest < new input
				largest = new input
			inputs ++
		else
			reset boolean flag to do math next time
	} while new input != done
	average = total / inputs
	range = largest - smallest
	print out Average, smallest, largest, range
end problem 1


Problem 2: Write a program that takes a string and prints each character on a new line
Start problem 2
	Prompt for text
	FOR loop where i is used in charAt method
		print each iteration on a new line
	end FOR
end problem 2


Problem 3:  Print out the  nth number in a Fibonacci sequence
Start Problem 3
	Prompt user for n
	if n < 2
		print "1"
	else
		for i < n, i++
			new = old1 + old 2
			old1 = old2
			old2 = new
		end for
	Print new
end problem 3

Problem 4: Print a multiplication table
Start Problem 4
	Set i to 1, for 10 times
		print i times each number from 1 - 10
	end for
end problem 4

Problem 5: Simulate the drunkdards walk over 100 intersections
Start Problem 5
	Explain what's going on
	set variable for north/south
	set variable for east/west
	for 100 times
		random number 0-3
		if 0 then north + 1
		if 1 then  north - 1
		if 2 then east + 1
		if 3 then east -1
	end for
	print results
end Problem 5

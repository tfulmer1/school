Unit 8 programs

Problem 1:  create a random array of integers and do stuff to it
	setup keyboard
	create array of length 10
	for i = 0, i < array.length, i++
		array[i] = rand.nextInt(100)+1;
	end
	
	declare variables for min (default to value 0), max (default to value 0), evenSum, oddSum, allSum;
	
	for (int number : numbers)
		if greater than max
			new max
		if less than min
			new min
		allSum += number
	end
	
	println("These are the ones at an even index")
		for i = 0 counting to array length
			if i is even
				print number at this index
			end
		end
	
	println("Here are the even numbers")
		for number in numbers
			if number is even
				print number
			end
		end
	
	println("Here is the list in reverse")
		for i = array length - 1 counting down to 0
			print the item at i index
		end
	
	print min
	print max
	print odd sum
	print even sum
	print total sum
End Problem 1


Problem 2:  creates a bar chart
	ask the user how many inputs they want on the chart
	int size = input
	new array labels of length = size
	new array values of length = size
	
	int position = 0
	int max = 0
	
	while position < length
		prompt for a label
		prompt for a value
		if value > max
			new max
		end
		move position
	end
	
	reset position to 0
	int bar = 0
	
	while position less than length
		print the label
		calculate relative bar length
		print * based on the bar length calculat
		move position
	end
End problem 2


Problem 3:  A class to handle movie ticket sales
	private static int[][] //setup 2d array with all seat/ticket prices shown
	
	private static void displaySeats()
		print top with seat numbers
		iterate through loop to show each row, display row number at front
		explain table
	end
	
	private static void buySeat(int price)
		declare row/seat variables
		if input price == 0
			prompt user for what row they want
			prompt user for what seat they want
			if seat is available
				sell seat
			else
				tell them the seat is sold
			end
		else
			iterate from 9,9 back towards 0,0
				if seat price == requested price
					sell seat
				end
				if no seats found
					"Sorry, nothing found at that price"
				end
			end
		end
	end
	
	main method()
		welcome to theater
		do while more seats want to be bought
			display seats
			prompt for desired price
			buyseats method call
			ask if they want more seats
		end do while
		thanks for buying tickets
		displaySeats()
	end
End Problem 3
